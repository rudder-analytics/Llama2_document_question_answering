The Python notebook is used to create a Chatbot for question-answering on the given two documents. 

Components:

1. Document Loader and Embeddings creation:

- The document loader is used to read the PDF files into a list of documents, where each document corrosponds to a page.
- RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter is used to split text documents into smaller chunks (or segments) for further processing.
- Used 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model which is a pretrained model used for generating embeddings.

2. Faiss:

- FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a utility that allows to quickly search for embeddings of documents that are similar to each other.
- Create an index or a database using FAISS which provides functions for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- Save the embeddings of both the PDFs into the FAISS Index.

3. Transformer pipeline:

- A transformer pipeline is used to Configure a text-generation pipeline using Hugging Face's Transformers library.
- Download the 'meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf' model from the Hugging Face Hub and pass it to the transformer pipeline object.

4. Langchain:

- LangChain is a library and framework designed to facilitate the development of applications and systems that leverage large language models (LLMs).
- Used Langchain to create a RetrievalQA chain which is used for question-answering against the FAISS index.
- Look for top 10 most relevant documents to generate the answer.
